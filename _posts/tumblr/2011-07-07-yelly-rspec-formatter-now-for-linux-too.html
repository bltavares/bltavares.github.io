<p>Today I got ath <a href="http://codebrawl.com/">CodeBrawl</a> and really got interest in one of the chalenges.</p>
<p>Reading the Rspec Format chalenge Yelly, The Yellingist Formatter, writen by Chad Humphries&lt;<a href="https://github.com/spicycode">github</a>&gt; got my attention. The only problem is that I don&#8217;t code on Mac, so I don&#8217;t have the `say` command.</p>
<p>So, I made an improvement to use it under Linux. It requires esound (for sound routing) and festival (for speech synthesis)</p>
<p>On Arch, you can set it up using</p>
<blockquote>
<p># pacman -S esound festival</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And here is the result. You may get it here &lt;<a href="https://gist.github.com/1070850"><a href="https://gist.github.com/1070850">https://gist.github.com/1070850</a></a>&gt;</p>
