<p>After creating a migration on Rails, I discovered you can&#8217;t set a column name as type.</p>
<p><em>It will break.</em></p>
<p>To fix it, pick the number on the begining of the migration file name and run:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>rake db:migrate:down VERSION={the number you found}</p>
</blockquote>
