<p>Last night I faced a bug on my tests using Fabricator and decided to share it. It took some time to solve a problem using memoizations and Fabricator together.</p>
<p><strong>Some context:</strong></p>
<p>I got users on teams, and teams has many memberships. I wanted to cache the accepted members to improve performace. When I was testing, the cache always returned empty, even changing the name of variables or using diferent techniques to cache.</p>
<p>And I became suprised when I tested it the memoized code on console and it was running perfectly</p>
<p>The fabricator of user is something like that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fabricator(:user) do</p>
<p>  name { Faker::Name.name}</p>
<p>  email { |person| &#8220;#{person.name.parameterize}@example.com&#8221; }</p>
<p>  password &#8220;123&#8221;</p>
<p>   teams [Fabricate(:team)]</p>
<p>end</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the Fabricator of Team is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fabricator(:team) do</p>
<p>  name { Faker::Name.name }</p>
<p>end</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>The problem:</strong></p>
<p>I was using the already created team by the fabricator relationship to create more memberships. But somehow, when I cached things, either using instance variables or ActiveSupport::Memoizeable I always got an empty {}.</p>
<p>So, after turning this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>@user = Fabricate(:user)</p>
<p>@second_user = Fabricate(:user, teams: [])</p>
<p>@team = @user.teams.first</p>
<p>@team.members &#171;&#160;@second_user</p>
</blockquote>
<p>to that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>@user = Fabricate(:user)</p>
<p>@second_user = Fabricate(:user, teams: [])</p>
<p>@team = @user.teams.create!({ name: &#8220;Teste&#8221;})</p>
<p>@team.members &#171;&#160;@second_user</p>
</blockquote>
<p>things worked like a charm on the tests.</p>
<p>(:</p>
